## Medical-ICT-Convergence-Based-Healthcare-Application

In this code, firmware commands for the bio NFC sensor manufactured by Texas Instruments are processed in real-time within an Android mobile application.

The bio-patch, which will be attached to patients, enables remote monitoring of pressure, temperature, and specific motion changes in the human vital signal and condition through the mobile application.

In the future, we plan to integrate this local database with an external server for enhanced data management and accessibility.
